### 我与你：埃里克·索斯

### THE SPACE BETWEEN US: ALEC SOTH

索斯使用的是一台三脚架上的大型玻璃板相机。它的操作过程很笨拙，需要镜头前的人有相当的耐心，在索斯神秘地消失在一大张毯子底下花费大量时间设置镜头的时候，必须保持静止。着看上去奇怪的像是维多利亚时期的工作方式，更适用于拍摄宏伟的野外景色。

“毯子底下很漂亮，”索斯说道。“在调整焦点平面的时候，你能够仔细凝视一个人的眉毛。然后，整个世界突然颠倒过来！我正努力应对技术挑战，正是这些挑战创造了这种美妙而紧张的能量。” ——肖恩·欧哈根 ，《卫报》，2019

Soth uses a large glass plate camera on a tripod. The process is unwieldy and requires a degree of patience from the sitter, who has to remain still while Soth sets up the shot, mysteriously disappearing for extended periods of time under a large blanket. It seems an oddly Victorian way to work, one more suited to the great outdoors.

"It's beautiful under that blanket," Soth says. "Getting to stare closely at someone's eyebrow as you shift the plane of focus. And, the world is upside down! I'm grappling with technical challenges that create this wonderful nervous energy."

“刚开始时我非常羞怯且容易尴尬，所以我的能量很小。但人们也常常用一种鼓励的方式来回应我。接着在做了更多杂志拍摄工作后，我有了更多的权力，也会通过施压来获得一张更好的照片。而现在，我想变得更加照顾被拍摄者的情绪，而不是用压迫的方式，即使我知道能够通过操控现场来获得一张更有力的照片。这我很擅长，而且能做的很巧妙，但是在我看来这种方式不再有趣了。我仍然在领舞，但我不会强求人们跟着我起舞。” —— 埃里克·索斯

"When I started out I had so little power because I was so shy and awkward. And often people responded to that in a positive way. Then, as I did more editorial, I got more power and I would push things in order to get a better picture. Now, I want to undercut that somehow by being a bit more sensitive less pushy there were times when I could have definitely made a more powerful picture by manipulating the situation. I'm good at that in a charming way, but it seems less interesting to me now. I'm still leading the dance, but I'm not pushing people around the dance floor." 

2004年，埃里克·索斯凭借《眠于密西西比河畔》这一拍摄美国小镇人物肖像的系列第一次受到关注。随后的几个系列分别探索了从“爱”到“可见/不可见”再到“逃离”的各种主题，每个系列都与美国中西部的生活背景息息相关。因其独特的视角，索斯被誉为当今美国社会及地理图景最杰出的摄影师之一。

Alec Soth first caught attention in 2004 with a series of portraits of people living in small-town American, a project he titled "Sleeping by the Mississippi". This was followed by a succession of projects exploring topics from love to (in)visibility to escape, each within the context of mid-western American life. For reasons of his unique perspective, Soth has been described as one of greatest photographers of American's social and geographical landscape at work today.

本次展览《我与你：埃里克·索斯》囊括了索斯各个重要系列中的代表之作。以系列为单位的创作是索斯一个独特而重要的艺术手法。“一个伟大摄影师的标志不是拍出一张惊艳的照片，而在于能构建一个完美的作品集合。”索斯如是说到。

"The Space Between Us" includes representative works from each of Soth's major series. Working in series is an important and distinctive aspect of his approach. 'The mark of a great photographer isn't taking one amazing photo,' he says, 'but the ablity to assemble an amazing collection.'

埃里克·索斯首先是一位艺术家，他的思维就像是一位用“光”来进行创作的画家一般。虽然在他的图像中，亲密与疏离的情绪随处可见，但在他的创作手法中，最重要的是对焦点的精妙选择；不同于肖像摄影的定式，索斯最感兴趣的是通过强调物体之间的空间来突出他们的关系。仔细观看这些图像，我们就会发现他是如何认真地审视自己和拍摄对象之间的空间关系。

Alec Soth is foremost an artist. He thinks like a painter whose material is light. While sensations of intimacy and isolation are found everywhere in his photographs, more important for his approach is the subtle choice of focal point; contrary to the conventions of portraiture, Soth is most interested in highlighting the relationship between objects by accenting the space between them. A careful look the pictures reveals how carefully he examines the space between himself and his subject.

索斯摄影的独特之处在于他创作肖像的方式。索斯喜欢走进一个人的生活，进入他们的心灵，就像踏入他们的生活空间一样。他将自己完全沉浸在某一时刻的情绪中，同样，这些图像也成为了他内心情绪的投射。

A unique aspect of his photography lies in the way he makes a portrait; Soth likes to step into a person's life, entering their psychological as much as their living space. Yet, in giving himself up to the mood of a moment, the photographs are often a reflection of his own mood as prompted by the encounter.

索斯的最新系列《我知道你的心跳有多剧烈》是在长达一年的沉寂之后所创作的。在那一年中，索斯反复思考并追寻着一个问题：“一张照片究竟能告诉我们什么？”或者说，“在这个每一秒都有50万个图像诞生的世界里，还有可能创作出有意义的照片吗？”在本次展览中，他的思考将通过他摄影生涯中的40多幅非凡图像逐渐揭示。

Soth's latest project, "I Know How Furiously Your Heart is Beating", was produced after a year-long hiatus in which he pondered the burning question 'What can a photograph really tell us about anything?' Or, 'How is it possible to make meaningful photograph in a world where half a million images are taken every second?' His musing is revealed here in 40 extraordinary images from Soth's career so far.

### 一个开端

1992 年从大学毕业之后，索斯回到了明尼苏达州开始工作。在那里，他拍摄了两个早期系列，《完美陌生人》1994年和《寻找爱》1996年。《完美陌生人》主要由在公园拍摄的人物肖像组成。埃里克将这种实践融入他的日常生活，因为他意识到要成为他理想中的那一类摄影师，他必须学会拍摄陌生人。拍摄《完美陌生人》的过程帮助埃里克理解了他所偏好的拍摄方式，并成为了他延续至今的创作方法的基石。《寻找爱》是对《完美陌生人》风格的第一次延申。

In 1992, after graduating from college, Alec returned to Minnesota to work. There, he shot two early series "Perfect Strangers" 1994, and "Looking for Love"1996. "Perfect Strangers" largely consists of portraits of people in a park, a practice that Alec made part of his daily routine because he realized that he had to be able to photograph strangers in order to become the kind of photographer he wanted to be. The process of making "Perfect Strangers" helped Alec understand his preferred way of photographing, and formed the basis of his approach through to today. "Looking for Love" was a first extension of the "Perfect Strangers" style.

埃里克·索斯现居于靠近密西西比河的明尼苏达州，那里也是他出生成长的地方。明尼苏达州被称为千湖之州，虽然地理上处于美国中北部并与加拿大接壤，但在区域上被划分为中西部的一部分。这片广袤的土地缺乏分明的特点，既不像美国西部一般荒凉神秘，也不如东海岸繁荣富足。如此一来，因为它太过平凡、不够“美国”，它常常被文学作品所忽略。

Alec Soth lives in Minnesota, where he was born and raised, close by the Mississippi River. Minnesota is known as the states of a Thousand Lakes, and although it is located in the north-central region of the United States, bordering Canada, it is considered part of the Midwest, a vast land that lacks distinctive characteristics being neither wild and mysterious as the American West, nor prosperous like the East Coast. As such, it is often overlooked in literary works because it is too ordinary and not "American" enough.

### 《眠于密西西比河畔》"Sleeping by the Mississippi"

在30岁之际，埃里克开启了自己首次沿着密西西比河的公路旅行，像马克·吐温小说中的哈克贝利·费恩一样寻找自由。这条河流本身就是一个关于漫长旅途的隐喻；它并不笔直地流淌，而是蜿蜒曲流，仿佛自身也在旅行之中。

密西西比河曾是美国经济的命脉。今天，它曾经的辉煌已然消逝。《眠于密西西比河畔》系列并不试图用线性的方式讲述一个具体的故事。相反，这些照片以一种最富诗意的方式相互交缠。对埃里克而言，他摄影家的身份使他能够四处游览，敲开陌生人的房门，并走入他们的生活，但是这种对探索世界的渴望就像一种角色扮演：他是故事的主角，被驱使着漫游这片广阔的土地并与陌生人相遇。公路旅行结束后，埃里克把这五年的拍摄成果编辑整理，然后用自家是打印机打印并制作了五十本摄影集分发至各处。正是这五十本自制摄影集让他从一个无人问津的公路旅行摄影师变成了一个享誉世界的艺术家。

At the age of 30, Alec embarked on his first road trip along the Mississippi River in search of freedom, like Huckleberry Finn in the Mark Twain novel. The river itself is a metaphor for an odyssey; it does not flow straight but meanders as if on its own journey. The Mississippi River used to be an economic lifeline of the United States. Today, its glory has faded. The "Sleeping by the Mississippi" project does not set out to tell a specific story in linear fashion. Instead, the photos intertwine in the most poetic way. Alec's identity as a photographer entitled him to visit places, knock on strangers' doors, and step into their lives. Yet, his yearning to explore the world was akin to a role-playing game: he is the main character in the story, driven to roam the vast land and encounter strangers.

After the road trip, Alec edited the works he had accumulated in the five years and with his home printer made fifty photo albums. The self-made album turned him from an unknown photographer into an internationally acclaimed artist.

### 《破碎手册》"Broken Manual"

《破碎手册》的灵感来自于一个为了逃避追捕而躲藏在森林中的逃犯的故事。埃里克开始拍摄那些选择远离人类常规居住区生活的隐士。他由此创作出了许多孤独忧伤的中老年男性的肖像，而他们都可以被视为摄影师自身的映像——虽然身为一名成年人，埃里克却有个男孩般的天真幻想，那就是对逃离的渴望，不仅是要逃避日常生活的压力，也是要理解逃离本身的现实，以及为此必须跨越的界限。他将《破碎手册》设想为一本指导人们如何从美国社会消失的手册，其中包括了对于如何分辨毒蘑菇和毒蜘蛛、如何寻找食物的说明。当然，正如标题所暗示的那样，《破碎手册》是一本永远无法被付诸实践的指南。

"Broken  Manual" was inspired by the story of a fugitive who eluded capture by hiding in a forest. Alec set out to photograph recluses who choose to live far from conventional human settlements. This resulted in numerous portraits of lonely, melancholy middle-aged and elderly men, all of whom may be seen as the photographer's reflection of himself -- Alec's boyish fantasy of running away is now an adult wish to escape the stress of daily life, but also to understand the reality of escape, and the boundaries that have to be crossed. He conceived "Broken Manual" as a guide to how to disappear from American society, which covers instructions on identifying poisonous mushrooms and spiders, and searching for food. Of course, as the title implies, "Broken Manual" is a guide that can never be put into practice. 

### 《歌本》"Songbook"

这个系列展现了埃里克·索斯在远离世界并创造出《破碎手册》之后，为了重新和世界建立连接所作的尝试。与作家布莱德·泽勒合作，两人进行了多次横跨美国的旅行，假扮记者，以著名当地歌曲的歌词为灵感，为一份虚构的报纸寻找当地有趣的故事。这些黑白照片试图通过充满感情、同时折射出当代美国文化缩影的微妙手法来讲述故事。《比尔，桑达斯基，俄亥俄》就是一个有代表性的画面，展现的是一位个性十足的老爷爷在练习舞步。

This series represents Alec Soth's attempt to reconnect with the world after running away to produce his "Broken Manual". Created in collaboration with the writer Brad Zellar, the two made cross-country trips posing as reporters in search of local interest stories for a fictional newspaper, inspired by the lyrics of well-known local songs. Shot in black and white, the photographs aim at storytelling via subtle means that are infused with emotion, but that reflect a microcosm of modern American culture. A typical frame is one like Bill, Sandusky, Ohio, which shows a grandfatherly man brimming with personality as he practices his dance moves.

### 《我知道你的心跳有多剧烈》"I Know How Furiously Your Heart is Beating"

这个系列标志着索斯摄影生涯的新阶段。它开始于长达一年的创作间断之后，期间，他隐居在自己的农舍中，反复思考着一个问题：“一张照片究竟能够告诉我们什么，特别是拍摄一个人的照片？” 在那一年的末尾，他开始旅行，并拍摄旅途中通过随机介绍遇见的人们。因此，《我知道你的心跳有多剧烈》是一组和拍摄对象的非正式接触中拍下的肖像和室内空间。埃里克描述这些相遇时说到，“我在试图了解他们是谁，也在思考我是谁。那就是这样一种舞蹈。”

This series marks a new phase in Alec's photography. It began after a year-long hiatus during which he retreated to his farmhouse to ponder the question "What can a photograph really tell us about anything, especially a person?" At the end of the year, he finally began to accept invitations to travel, and to photograph people he met through random introductions along the way. "I Know How Furiously Your Heart is Beating" is thus a group of portraits and interior scenes that created during informal encounters with the subjects. 'I'm trying to figure out who they are, and trying to figure out who I am. It's this kind of dance,' Alec says of these encounters.

### 《尼亚加拉》Niagara

在与密西西比河纠缠之后，埃里克转向了另一处著名的水体，尼亚加拉大瀑布。这个知名的旅游景点不仅是人们蜜月旅行和家庭出游时最喜欢的目的地，也逐渐吸引了那些想要戏剧化地结束自己生命的人。随着商业习惯的转变，尼亚加拉当地的经济衰退。埃里克最后住在一个破败的汽车旅馆里，其中颓废的氛围呼应了他在周围世界感受到的对爱的失望。这些照片传递出对婚姻生活的看法含混不清，充斥着一种孤独的气氛。

After his affair with the Mississippi River, Alec turned to another famous body of water, Niagara Falls, the well-known tourist attraction that is a favorite destination for honeymooners and family trips, and later even those seeking a dramatic end to their lives. Against shifting commercial habits, Niagara's local economy  declined. Alec found himself staying in rundown motels, where the aura of abandon echoed the disappointment in love he sensed in the world around him. The photographs offer an ambiguous view of matrimony, infused with a pervasive air of loneliness.
