“About EFi” by EFi https://link.medium.com/405gg2DOG9



EFi is committed to promoting and integrating the development of the entire EOS ecosystem, including DeFi and Dapps. EFi will lead EOS to a whole new level.

EFi致力于促进和整合整个EOS生态系统的发展，包括DeFi和DAPP。EFi 将把EOS带到一个全新的水平。

##### Why EOS?

For a long time, Ethereum has always been the leader of DeFi, but the high fees and complicated DeFi logic of Ethereum have prevented a large number of users from really participating in DeFi applications. And another application-based public chain, TRON, is too centralized. Projects that cannot be recognized by Justin are difficult to develop.

长期以来，以太坊一直是DeFi的领头羊，但以太坊高昂的费用和复杂的DeFi逻辑使得大量用户无法真正参与DeFi应用。而另一个基于应用程序的公共链TRON过于集中。无法被Justin认可的项目很难开发。

EOS, as a public chain with excellent performance, is more suitable than any public chain to undertake user groups that cannot be reached by Ethereum DeFi.

EOS作为一个性能优异的公共链，比任何公共链都更适合承担以太坊DeFi无法到达的用户群。

##### How to ensure the safety of funds?

EOS’s DeFi ecosystem has just begun, and the infrastructure is not complete. In addition, it has been criticized because the EOS contract can be modified after deployment.

EOS的DeFi生态系统刚刚开始，基础设施还不完善。此外，由于EOS合同在部署后可以修改，因此受到了批评。

However, with the emergence of a large number of EOS applications in the past two years, the current contract vulnerabilities are very rare. As long as the formal audit is conducted, the EOS contract security can be guaranteed.

然而，随着近两年大量EOS应用的出现，目前合同漏洞非常少见。只要进行正式审核，EOS合同的安全性是可以保证的。

The EOS contract can be modified after deployment, and it can be solved by multi-signature or private key destruction. Due to the emergence of multi-signature, the DeFi application on EOS is more flexible and reliable, and problems can be repaired in a more timely manner, and there will be no YAM Tragedy on Ethereum.

EOS合约在部署后可以修改，可以通过多重签名或私钥销毁来解决。由于多重签名的出现，使得DeFi在EOS上的应用更加灵活可靠，问题可以得到更及时的修复，不会出现以太坊YAM的悲剧。

##### What is EFi going to do?

Compared with ETH, the current DeFi applications in the EOS ecosystem are still very rudimentary. The emergence of EFi will complement the DeFi shortcomings on EOS, and give full play to the application advantages of EOS at the same time. Applications such as games on EOS will take off again with DeFi.

与ETH相比，目前DeFi在EOS生态系统中的应用还很初级。EFi的出现将弥补DeFi在EOS上的不足，同时充分发挥EOS的应用优势。EOS上的游戏等应用程序将随着DeFi再次起飞。

##### Diamond (already online)

Diamond is the first EFi project. It first promotes the entire EOS ecosystem through lock-in mining, which not only drives the price of EOS, but also attracts the attention of the entire blockchain field, and will further promote the issuance of the stablecoin USDT on EOS. In the future, Diamond will turn to financial management (vault) so that users can get the most benefits from locked assets.

钻石是第一个EFi项目。它首先通过锁定挖掘推动整个EOS生态系统，这不仅推动了EOS的价格，也吸引了整个区块链领域的关注，并将进一步推动稳定币 USDT在EOS上的发行。未来，Diamond将转向财务管理（金库），以便用户能够从锁定的资产中获得最大的收益。

DMD  will be the token to link the whole EFi ecology.

DMD将成为连接整个EFi生态的token。

Benchmarking project: Ethereum YFI, which current market value is $928,706,674

标杆项目：以太坊YFI，目前市值为$928,706,674

##### eHUB (upcoming)

eHUB is an open protocol that can realize private cross-chain value transfer without permission. The eHUB network (with SDK attached) allows developers to introduce cross-chain assets into their applications.

eHUB是一个开放的协议，可以实现私有的跨链价值转移。eHUB网络（附带SDK）允许开发人员将跨链资产引入到他们的应用程序中。

For example, you can deposit your own native BTC or ETH as collateral into its eHUB gateway, and the smart contract of the eHUB virtual machine will issue corresponding hETH on EOS.

例如，您可以将自己的本地的BTC或ETH作为抵押品存入其eHUB网关，eHUB虚拟机的智能合约会在EOS上发布相应的hETH。

eHUB can greatly expand the value carrying of existing DeFi applications and create a brand new business model.

eHUB可以极大地扩展现有DeFi应用的价值承载能力，创造一种全新的商业模式。

Benchmarking project: Ethereum Ren Protocol, which current market value is $339,112,293

标杆项目：以太坊Ren协议，目前市场价值为$339,112,293

##### eMulti (not online)

eMulti is an automatic market making protocol similar to Uniswap, but with many differences from Uniswap, eMuti’s liquidity pool will support multiple currencies, and the usual SWAP project can only support two.

eMulti是一种类似于Uniswap的自动做市协议，但与Uniswap有许多不同，eMuti的流动性池将支持多种货币，而通常的SWAP项目只能支持两种货币。

Secondly, weights can be set for each currency, so there is no need to ensure that the dollar value of each currency in the pool is equal, like Uniswap, and the asset allocation of the market maker will be more flexible.

其次，可以为每种货币设定权重，因此不必像Uniswap那样确保池中每种货币的美元价值相等，做市商的资产配置将更加灵活。

The creator of the eMuti liquidity pool has the authority to modify the parameters of the liquidity pool, but in terms of revenue, all liquidity providers are the same.

eMuti流动性池的创建者有权修改流动性池的参数，但就收入而言，所有流动性提供者都是相同的。

Benchmarking project: Ethereum Balancer, which current market value is $171,451,091

标杆项目：以太坊Balancer，目前市值$171,451,091

##### eMutual (not online)

eMutual is a mutual-aid insurance used to provide risk protection for all products on EOS.

eMutual是一种互助保险，用于为EOS上的所有产品提供风险保护。

eMutual is a mutual-aid insurance solution in which members of the mutual-aid association contribute funds and share risks. You can purchase insurance to reduce asset losses caused by Smart Contract code defects or hacker attacks on EOS.

emutial是一种互助保险解决方案，互助协会的成员提供资金并分担风险。您可以购买保险，以减少智能合约代码缺陷或黑客攻击EOS造成的资产损失。

eMutual will greatly reduce users’ financial concerns about participating in DeFi or other products on EOS.

Emutial将大大减少用户对参与DeFi或其他EOS产品的财务担忧。
